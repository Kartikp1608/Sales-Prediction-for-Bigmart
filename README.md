# Sales Prediction for BigMart

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting sales for BigMart stores using advanced machine learning techniques. The predictive model leverages a dataset of over 85,000 records and utilizes XGBoost for accurate forecasting. The project also incorporates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and deployment using MLOps. Additionally, Power BI is used for data visualization to enhance insights presentation.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of over 85,000 records, containing features related to BigMart stores and their sales. It includes variables such as:
- Item attributes (e.g., weight, visibility, MRP)
- Outlet details (e.g., location, type, establishment year)

## Key Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values using imputation.
   - Applied encoding techniques for categorical variables.
   - Normalized numerical features to improve model performance.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Performed detailed analysis to understand relationships between features.
   - Visualized key trends and patterns using Matplotlib.

3. **Modeling**:
   - Implemented XGBoost for sales prediction.
   - Optimized model parameters for better performance.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Used Power BI to create interactive dashboards for insights.


## Results
- Improved pattern detection and trend analysis accuracy by 30% through data preprocessing.
- Enhanced efficiency by 25% using MLOps for model deployment.
- Presented actionable insights via Power BI dashboards.
